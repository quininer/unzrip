# Unzrip

Simple unzip implementation

## Automatic detection filename encoding

If you have ever downloaded a zip file with
an encoded filename using a character set such as GBK or SHIFT-JIS,
then you know what that means.

##  Parallel decompression

All files in zip can be decompressed independently,
which means that more files there are,
the more significant the performance improvement.

## Safety

If you know unzip has been inactive for over 10year
and downstream requires 20+ of security patches.
